These tests have been automated because:


- they are run frequently (after every build) and require large amounts of data to perform the same action
- these tests tend to cause human error
- these tests require multiple data sets
- cover frequently used functionality that introduces high risk conditions
- these tests take a lot of effort and time when manual testing
